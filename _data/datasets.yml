  description: The Gini Index is a summary measure of income inequality. The Gini
    coefficient incorporates the detailed shares data into a single statistic, which
    summarizes the dispersion of income across the entire income distribution. The
    Gini coefficient ranges from 0, indicating perfect equality (where everyone receives
    an equal share), to 1, perfect inequality (where only one recipient or group of
    recipients receives all the income). The Gini is based on the difference between
    the Lorenz curve (the observed cumulative income distribution) and the notion
    of a perfectly equal income distribution.
