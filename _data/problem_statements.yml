- Background: "Every decade, in years ending in \u201C0,\u201D the U.S. Census Bureau\
    \ conducts its Decennial Census, apportioning representation in the U.S. House\
    \ of Representatives, as well as federal funds for critical infrastructure and\
    \ services such as housing, highways, schools, hospitals, and scores of programs\
    \ that are vital to the health and welfare of the U.S. population and economy.In\
    \ addition to the Decennial Census, the U.S. Census Bureau conducts other critical\
    \ surveys such as the Economic Census and the American Community Survey, which\
    \ can help businesses do their planning, and measure the health of our economy\
    \ and places. It is critical that all those living in the U.S. participate in\
    \ the Census. It is therefore vital that people know the impact that Census has\
    \ on their lives, families, communities, and societies. Yet certain groups have\
    \ been undercounted at disproportionately high rates, including rural communities,\
    \ children, and those experiencing homelessness. We are bringing together teams\
    \ of partners from across industries and sectors to ideate new technology platforms\
    \ and solutions that will drive participation nationwide."

  Vision for sprint outcomes: People living in America know the impact of the Census
    on their lives, family, community and society, and are therefore are driven to
    participate. Learning how to take the Census will be as easy as going to vote.gov.
  Why this problem matters: "When people and businesses participate in the Census,\
    \ they further drive its value by ensuring a complete count. Having an accurate\
    \ count then ensures the fair distribution of federal spending and apportionment\
    \ of congressional seats. When segments of the population are undercounted, it\
    \ results in fewer resources allocated, imprecise policy recommendations, and\
    \ less congressional representation for those communities. The 2020 Census will\
    \ also be the first to have an online response option, presenting new challenges\
    \ with those who aren\u2019t digitally connected, but also opening up new opportunities\
    \ for creative solutions."

  Target audience / End user: U.S. recycling facilities and manufacturers looking
    to produce, sell, and buy quality recycled materials; rural or tribal communities;
    organizations and state and local governments striving to improve their recycling
    facilities and infrastructure.
  Why this problem matters: Recycling facilities, ranging from those operated by large
    waste management corporations to smaller, family-owned facilities, process the
    nearly 70M tons of material that Americans throw into their recycling bins each
    year. While international markets were historically significant purchasers of
    materials from these U.S. recycling facilities, recent years have seen tightening
    of international markets, due largely to contamination of traditional recycling
    streams by newer products (e.g., plastic bags, flexible pouches, and lithium batteries),
    which our outdated recycling infrastructure is ill-equipped to manage. Many recycling
    facilities are unable to fill the gap left by international markets, as they are
    not connected to domestic manufacturers (e.g., paper mills, bottling plants) that
    have demand for using these recycled materials in new products. These dynamics
    have contributed to recycling programs across the country shrinking or even shutting
    down.

  Vision for sprint outcomes: 'With user-friendly digital tools, MBEs and MEs are

  Why this problem matters: "Minority owned businesses are critical to the national\
    \ and local economies. They are a critical part of job creation and preservation\
    \ for more than 2.2 million jobs. Yet these businesses face obstacles to surviving\
    \ and thriving, particularly because of difficulty accessing capital. The 2021\
    \ Small Business Credit Survey found that Black-owned firms that applied for traditional\
    \ forms of financing were least likely to receive all of the financing they sought\
    \ -- 40% of white-owned firms received all of the financing they sought, compared\
    \ to 31% of asian-owned firms, 20% of Hispanic-owned, and only 13% of black-owned\
    \ firms. This trend persists even among firms with good credit scores.  One key\
    \ reason for the lack of bank financing for MBEs is lower credit, lower net worth,\
    \ and lack of assets, and.without alternative capital options, businesses either\
    \ reduce operational capacity or go out of business. \n\nWithout the ability to\
    \ access needed capital, minority businesses often find themselves struggling\

    \ difficult to find the programs most relevant to their locality, and lower-resourced\
    \ communities in particular lack the technical assistance needed to develop quality\
    \ grant applications that have a higher chance of being selected.  This reinforces\

- Background: Many state and local governments do not have a database of addresses
    with geospatial coordinates (also known as address point data), which is critical
    for high priority issues like emergency response. In some cases, where the governments
    have address point data, it is not openly available due to propriety or legal
    constraints. Many state and local governments do not have the resources to plan,
    implement, and maintain address point data collection activities. Resources needed
    to overcome data collection challenges include software tools, starter data, human
    capital, collection processes and guidelines, and data system integration.
  Challenge: "Develop resources that help tribal, state, and local governments to\

  Vision for sprint outcomes: Outcomes from The Opportunity Project provide the momentum
    needed for tribal, state, and local governments to begin to fill in address point
    data gaps across the nation and to share the data openly, and help to share best
    practices for workflows and processes, including metadata
  Why this problem matters: 'Tribal, state, and local address point data are critical
    to all levels of government. During catastrophic events such as hurricanes and
    wild fires, residences and businesses cannot be located using traditional means
    of address navigation since the structures, street signs, and landmarks no longer
    exist. An easily accessible data base of reliable, accurate, and uniform/standardized
    address point data can meet the immediate needs of emergency responders and communities
    in crisis. A complete address data base is also needed to accurately count citizens
    through censuses and surveys in order for governments to receive their share of
    federal funds and be accurately represented. For example, in 2015, Census Bureau
    data was used to distribute more than $675 billion in funds. Address data is also
    critical for the Master Address File (MAF) used for the decennial census and ongoing
    surveys. For the Department of Transportation (DOT), complete, accurate, and up-to-date
    addresses with location data is critical to transportation safety and the National
    911 Program, which envisions an emergency response system that best serves the
    public, providing immediate help in all emergency situations. Mail delivery, real
    estate and land use decisions, and public health tracking also depend on address
    point data. The Census Bureau and DOT are committed to improving data completeness,
    accuracy and currency, which are key to successful development of a National Address
    Database (NAD) as a National Geospatial Data Asset (NGDA). '

  Background: To many Americans ,earning a 4-year university degree is held up as
    the most attractive, prestigious or only path toward a successful career. Yet,
    educational institutions, companies, unions, and other entities are increasingly
    creating multiple, alternative pathways to careers, including apprenticeships,
    secondary career and technical education programs, community college degree and
    certificate programs, boot camps, industry certificates, combinations of the above,
    and new programs that have not yet been invented. These programs unfairly lack
    the prestige of a college degree, when they often could link to a college degree,
    possibly paid for by an employer. This is in part because for the past several
    decades, American higher education and workforce development has focused on encouraging
    high school students to attend college after graduation. In contrast, in countries
    like Germany and Switzerland, career and technical education, including apprenticeships,
    is highly prestigious in society and culture. While college can be very beneficial
    for many people, it ignores a large swath of Americans who don't necessarily want
    to attend college right after school, don't want to accrue tens of thousands of
    dollars in student loan debt, or who simply want to enter the workforce immediately
    after graduation. To realize the true potential of the American workforce, students
    need to be fully aware of all pathways to careers. Educational institutions, companies,
    unions, and other organizations need to market them as attractive, prestigious,
    and cost-effective career paths for young people. In short, multiple pathways
    need to be easier to find.
  Challenge: Create digital tools that help American workers to consider and take
    advantage of the multiple pathways available to find or advance in careers. Tools
    could 1)make multiple pathways to career success more attractive by helping people
    envision them as exciting and prestigious, and/or 2) help to make data on these
    opportunities user friendly and discoverable by American workers.

  Target audience / End user: Decision-makers (e.g. superintendents, principals, school

    city council members), and parents
  Vision for sprint outcomes: A local superintendent sees that students in a certain
    part of his district do not have the same access to rigorous coursework as those
    in another part and adjusts course offerings by making different decisions around
    human capital and budgeting. A principal sees that her school has far fewer actual
    resources than a school with a similar demographic of students and uses the data
    to make their case to the school board and superintendent for additional resources.
    A parent sees gaps between groups (e.g. English learners and non-English learners)
    of students citywide in access to experienced teachers, investigates and discovers
    that is because there is not enough support given to teachers of ELs so they turnover
    more frequently, and works with the school district and school board to address
    those gaps.
  Why this problem matters: 'Within and across school districts and communities there
    are significant disparities in outcomes (e.g. achievement, graduation rate) between
    different student groups, in whole or in part due to inequitable access to resources
    (e.g. per-pupil expenditures, rigorous coursework, effective teachers). Decision-makers
    (e.g. superintendents, principals, school board members, state departments of
    education), municipal leaders (e.g. mayors, city council members), and parents

  Background: 'Knowledge, technology, and innovation are the engines of our economy

    economy, making knowledge even more important to the future of the workforce and
    economic growth. To drive business innovation and productive regional economies,
    communities across the U.S. need intellectual capital, but there is an increasing
    geographic divide in talent.  Large cities like Boston, New York, and San Francisco
    have seen a decade of entrepreneurship growth and increasing capital investment,
    and boast a burgeoning entrepreneurial ecosystem of business incubators, accelerators,
    and high-growth companies. But mid-sized cities (with 250,000-1 million residents)
    across the U.S. are just starting to experience similar activity. In these places

  Vision for sprint outcomes: "A volunteer firefighter in St Mary\u2019s county, MD\
    \ has been selling donuts all year to raise funds for a new fire truck. He uses\
    \ a tool to look up his town and types of emergency services. He then sees that\
    \ his town has FAR fewer emergency vehicles than its neighbors, realizes that\
    \ his town had not taken advantage of RD\u2019s grant and loan programs for emergency\
    \ equipment and vehicles, and is better able to allocate local resources."
  Why this problem matters: "Many small towns lack the capacity/human capital to take\
    \ advantage of programs (e.g. grants and low cost loans for broadband, health\
    \ facilities, water systems, businesses, housing) for which they are eligible.\
    \ Often times the \u201Cgrant writer\u201D for a rural community is its part-time\
    \ mayor, who fills out applications on her dining room table after work. Recognizing\
    \ stretched local capacity, community leaders and residents would benefit from\
    \ information regarding available programs and funds."

- Background: The Federal government has extensive data that currently exists in silos.
    Agencies maintain data about their programs, open data sources maintain various
    elements of meta data, and government-wide systems like Performance.gov and USASpending.gov
    hold data about specific areas of Federal operations. Although the Federal government
    has made strides with improving accountability and transparency, linking these
    data sets together would tell a holistic story of federal financial management.
  Challenge: Develop public facing tools that link federal spending and performance
    (or outcome) data to provide comprehensive insight into the use of federal taxpayer
    dollars across programs.

  Vision for sprint outcomes: 'Connect Federal financial and performance data in high
    impact areas such as disaster relief, infrastructure, and financial assistance,
    allowing the American public to track progress in key areas, unlock economic opportunities,
    and expand research capabilities. '
  Why this problem matters: "In 2017, the Federal government spent over $3 trillion\
    \ dollars in financial assistance. While USASpending.gov provides access to federal\
    \ spending data at lower levels of granularity, there is still an opportunity\
    \ to enhance transparency and show the American public how programs are performing\
    \ with tax payer dollars. With an increase in spending in high impact areas such\
    \ as disaster relief, there is public interest in more accountability and transparency\
    \ into federal spending. Linking federal spending and performance in high impact\
    \ areas using government open data can enhance data transparency, promote economic\
    \ growth and research, and improve services to the American public. The President\u2019\
    s Management Agenda also places a priority on leveraging data as a strategic asset\
    \ to grow the economy, increase the effectiveness of the Federal Government, facilitate\
    \ oversight, and promote transparency."

  Target audience / End user: Emergency shelters, homeless advocates, landlords
  Vision for sprint outcomes: Cynthia and her 1 year old son John have gone to an
    emergency shelter to escape an abusive relationship. Cynthia has not worked since
    her son was born but had previously worked as wait staff. The Emergency Shelter
    had determined that with short term housing assistance and services to connect
    her with child care and helping her locate a job, she could escape her abusive
    situation and live on her own. What the Emergency Shelter needs is an easy way
    to identify available units that Cynthia might be comfortable living, with the
    landlord willing to accept payment from the homeless provider for a specified
    time period.
  Why this problem matters: "Research has shown that for homeless families Rapid Rehousing\
    \ \u2013 having the homeless provider pay the rent on an apartment for 6 to 18\
    \ months and providing intensive services during that time frame \u2013 is a far\
    \ more cost effective way to quickly address families in crisis than other methods\
    \ such as Transitional Housing and longer stays in Emergency Shelter. The problem\
    \ is connecting potential landlords with the providers of services to the homeless."

  Target audience / End user: |
    Children and youth, parents, educators, community-based organizations, and other service providers in Puerto Rico.
  Vision for sprint outcomes: Through the creation and distribution of child- and
    youth-friendly tools and resources specifically designed for the unique culture,
    language, and resources in Puerto Rico, more children and youth in Puerto Rico
    could have access to new skills and resources to strengthen their responses to
    adversity.
  Why this problem matters: COVID-19 and other disasters have exacerbated and shined
    a light on critical gaps in behavioral health care for children and youth in the
    United States.  All levels of government, as well as many communities, youth,
    and families across the country, are focused on addressing this challenge.  In
    December 2021, the U.S. Surgeon General released an Advisory on Protecting Youth
    Mental Health, which highlighted that rates of psychological distress among young
    people, including symptoms of anxiety, depression, and other mental health disorders,
    increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Mental health emergencies among young
    people have also increased.  In 2020, there was a 24 percent increase in emergency
    room visits for mental health reasons for children ages 5 through 11, and more
    than a 30 percent increase in such visits for those ages 12 to 17.  Tools and
    resources to address stigma and promote resilience in children and youth must
    be created in consultation and partnership with the end user (children and youth)
    and must be culturally relevant and user friendly.  Advancing equity in mental
    health for children and youth in Puerto Rico is particularly pressing because
    of the significant exposure to natural disasters, the impact of COVID-19 in the
    community, and the limited access to resources to support and strengthen the mental
    health of children and youth.

  Target audience / End user: Low to moderate income heads of households; case managers;
    guidance counselors; life coaches; community and ministry leaders; service providers;
    philanthropic organizations; federal, state and local government service program
    managers, policy makers, legislators.
  Why this problem matters: Approximately 30 departments and agencies across the federal
    government offer over 200 federal programs that could assist low income families
    in their journeys towards self-sufficiency. There are also innumerable private
    programs intended to achieve the same end. However, the sheer number of programs
    and the lack of integration and accessibility create unnecessary barriers for
    families to find, connect with, and utilize the services that best suit their
    particular needs. Heads of households also lack a way to assess their own strengths
    and weaknesses, to set goals, create a roadmap, and engage with community partners
    to accelerate their journey into economic mobility. Through its EnVision Center
    initiative, HUD designated brick and mortar facilities to serve as centralized
    hubs to support low-income households seeking to achieve self-sufficiency. While
    the centers are effective, their reach is limited to their local areas.

  Target audience / End user: Historically undercounted populations and organizations

    5, people experiencing homelessness, renters, and members of underrepresented
    minorities
  Why this problem matters: Given that the population count from the Census determines
    redistricting, the allocation of seats in the House of Representatives, and close
    to $700 billion in federal funding are allocated to communities across the nation
    for the next 10 years, ensuring an accurate count is essential. An undercount
    has significant long-term implications for communities. For example, in the 2010
    Census, nearly 1 million children (4.6% of children under the age of 5) were not
    counted. This can contribute to inaccurate school enrollment projections  and
    result in overcrowding and teacher shortages.

  Why this problem matters: 'In the last five years, more than 250,000 refugees have
    been resettled in the United States. Refugees are provided assistance by one of
    the nine resettlement agencies for 90 days, after which they are responsible for
    navigating their path to self-sufficiency and integration into American society,
    but often lacking the language skills necessary. There are many organizations
    that provide assistance after the resettlement agencies, but many refugees may
    not be familiar with these services or unsure of how to ask for help. By designing
    a solution to connect resettled refugees to nonprofits and community-based organizations,
    the following outcomes may be achieved: (1) refugees will have increased familiarity
    of local services; (2) refugees can select services holistically (education, mental
    health, jobs, etc.); (3) refugee can be empowered to successfully resettle (4)
    refugees can have their specific needs met versus a one-size fits all approach.'

  Target audience / End user: Federal, state, tribal, and local policymakers; communities
    interested in aligning public spending and policymaking priorities with contributors
    to well-being.
  Vision for sprint outcomes: 'Through the use of data and community input, federal
    and local policymakers can begin to identify new indicators that capture dimensions
    of well-being beyond traditional economic indicators.  Doing so will help elevate
    the things that matter most to households and communities, and in turn shape policy
    priorities.  For example, it may help policymakers select infrastructure projects
    that go beyond refreshing aging roads and instead target well-being goals holistically:
    such as new economic opportunities for residents, public spaces that contribute
    to good mental and physical health, and/or investments that prioritize equity.'
  Why this problem matters: "Resiliency among households and communities requires\
    \ more than economic means.  Weathering an unprecedented disruption to everyday\
    \ life like the COVID-19 pandemic has required strong social networks, stable\
    \ housing, healthy food, access to outdoor recreational space, mental health resources,\
    \ and other social infrastructure, which many have not had access to.  At the\
    \ same time, the OECD\u2019s better life index gives the U.S. low marks in several\
    \ areas of well-being despite the U.S. leading the entire OECD in household income.\
    \  Americans work longer hours, have lower life expectancies, and are exposed\
    \ to more air pollution than most other OECD nations.  The pandemic has also underscored\
    \ how the impacts of crises are felt unevenly across the U.S., particularly amongst\
    \ different racial and ethnic groups and in communities of color, and how individual\
    \ stressors can compound within communities. \n\nHowever, these resources, challenges,\
    \ and disparities are not captured by macroeconomic measures such as the unemployment\
    \ rate or GDP, and traditional measures of economic progress fail to account for\
    \ the multiple dimensions of well-being that matter to individuals, families,\
    \ and communities.  Furthermore, little is done to understand the shared experiences\
    \ of people across the nation.  Some communities, like Santa Monica, CA, have\
    \ developed new well-being measures to assess progress at a local level.  This\
    \ is a promising step forward but has not changed the national narrative about\
    \ equitable social and economic progress. \n\nThe cross-sector community focused\
    \ on well-being in the U.S. does not currently have agreed-upon measures of the\
    \ economic, cultural, social, natural, and other forms of well-being that contribute\
    \ to a flourishing life.  Yet the presence of national-level indicators is critical\
    \ because the federal government, along with local stakeholders, is currently\
    \ making significant investments in infrastructure and other pillars of recovery\
    \ with the aim of enabling all Americans to fully participate in the economy.\
    \  These investments have the potential to advance the resilience and well-being\
    \ of families and communities across the country if they start with what matters\
    \ most to people in their communities and the foundational aspects of well-being\
    \ such as belonging, stability, meaningful access to resources, and more.  This\
    \ requires being in dialogue with households and communities, centering their\
    \ lived experience, and seeking their input into the development of indicators\
    \ to evaluate and report on well-being.\n"

    organizations and state and local governments striving to improve their recycling
    facilities and infrastructure.
  Why this problem matters: Recycling facilities, ranging from those operated by large
    waste management corporations to smaller, family-owned facilities, process the
    nearly 70M tons of material that Americans throw into their recycling bins each
    year. While international markets were historically significant purchasers of
    materials from these U.S. recycling facilities, recent years have seen tightening
    of international markets, due largely to contamination of traditional recycling
    streams by newer products (e.g., plastic bags, flexible pouches, and lithium batteries),
    which our outdated recycling infrastructure is ill-equipped to manage. Many recycling
    facilities are unable to fill the gap left by international markets, as they are
    not connected to domestic manufacturers (e.g., paper mills, bottling plants) that
    have demand for using these recycled materials in new products. These dynamics
    have contributed to recycling programs across the country shrinking or even shutting
    down.

  Target audience / End user: Engaged citizens and the general public, especially

    those with respiratory ailments), urban populations and communities (e.g., high
    transportation traffic areas), rural or tribal communities, and motorized vehicles
    users.
  Why this problem matters: "Transportation emissions make up almost one-third of\
    \ the nation\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to air pollution that\
    \ have significant health ramifications. Every year, 7 million people worldwide\
    \ die from air pollution. Furthermore, 80 percent of people living in urban areas\
    \ that monitor air pollution breathe in air that exceeds WHO guideline limits.\
    \ Communities\u2019 choices about the transportation of their members as well\
    \ as everyday goods play a significant role in air pollution, but it is difficult\
    \ to convey this type of information easily to the public, as well as to point\
    \ to actions that individuals can take to help. It is hard to take action even\
    \ when one wants to."

  Why this problem matters: 'Job placement professionals such as vocational caseworkers
    at one-stop shops and community resource centers do not have access to a real-time,

    job opportunities that fit them best. They rely primarily rely on word-of- mouth

    \ set of solutions. Veterans interact with many organizations and service providers\
    \ to address career transition, health, and other challenges These groups are\

    \ in civilian life; numerous organizations, including VA and Veterans Service\
    \ Organizations (VSOs), interface with veterans and yet lack a unified communication\

    \ veteran experiencing homelessness; even when a veteran is given resources for\
    \ temporary housing; barriers to basic, practical needs such as a ride to and\
    \ from a medical appointment or a job interview prevent veterans from regaining\
    \ their independence. \L In order to optimize the veteran\u2019s experience and\
    \ outcomes, veterans need technology tools that will help them to connect with\
    \ jobs that are suited to their individual strengths and specific skills, and\
    \ connect with transportation to critical appointments such as job interviews.\

  Vision for sprint outcomes: Small businesses in South Florida will become more integrated
    into the innovative business ecosystem by incorporating technology into their
    workflows, enabling equitable growth, social equity and greater opportunities
    for small business owners and employees.  We hope this sprint will contribute
    to creating new business opportunities and jobs in the community through the application
    of technology, as well as improve quality of service for customers and business
    competitiveness with a combination of digital literacy, process efficiencies,
    and cyber-infrastructure. Additionally, the sprint could provide the digital infrastructure
    and capacity for companies to process the volume and speed of data with the latest
    technology to be effective in a highly competitive international business ecosystem.
  Why this problem matters: "In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, many small businesses\
    \ struggled to stay afloat. As of May 2021, the number of U.S. small businesses\

    \ well as [increased expenses](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/institute/research/small-business/report-small-business-expenses-during-COVID-19)\
    \ and new operational realities given health and safety restrictions. During the\
    \ pandemic, much of the economy also transitioned online. However, only 29% of\
    \ small businesses in Florida report benefiting from online sales, highlighting\
    \ inequities in preparation for this shift. Given these challenges, economic recovery\
    \ will also not be straightforward for smaller scale operations. However, small\
    \ businesses play a critical role in the economy, with 60% of net new job gains\

  Why this problem matters: Ocean plastics directly impact more than 800 species world-wide.  Further,
    because plastics never completely degrade, microplastics in the environment threaten
    human as well as environmental health.  Participation in citizen science shows
    that the public clearly cares.  Citizen scientists do not always stay engaged
    and keep sharing data over time.  In addition, citizen science volunteers do not
    always have access to contextual information on why plastic might be there and
    what they can do.  The lack of data on plastics pollution and related information
    prevents citizen scientists and the public policy community from fully understanding
    the extent of the problem and making informed choices to reduce the growing threat
    of plastic pollution to human and environmental health.

  Target audience / End user: Tribal, federal, state, and municipal government leaders;
    mail delivery stakeholders; community members; advocates; first responders in
    the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico
  Vision for sprint outcomes: This TOP sprint will provide the necessary momentum
    for municipal governments to continue their efforts to fill in locatable address
    and street name gaps, standardize and openly share address information, and develop
    best practices to build an address data infrastructure that will advance equity
    and benefit communities.
  Why this problem matters: "Though often taken for granted, locatable civic addresses\
    \ are critical during catastrophic events such as hurricanes and earthquakes,\
    \ when residences and businesses cannot be located using traditional means of\
    \ navigation that rely on structures, street signs, and landmarks.  Residents\
    \ of housing units that lack a locatable civic address may not receive services\
    \ or assistance, such as emergency aid, as well as utilities, mail and package\
    \ delivery.  These services can even be out of reach to residents with existing\
    \ addresses if they are not locatable and portrayed in consistent, uniform, and\
    \ unambiguous ways to service providers. \n\nUnfortunately, much of Puerto Rico\
    \ faces a myriad of local addressing challenges including a lack of locatable\
    \ civic addresses.  First, many housing units do not have a unique address, and\
    \ there may be several homes with the same address.  Second, many housing units\
    \ have mailing addresses that are not locatable to people on the ground and not\
    \ locatable by digital mapping applications (e.g., P.O. Box and Highway Contract\
    \ Route addresses).  Third, citizens and institutions may not be aware of how\
    \ to portray addresses so they are easily understood and can be processed by automated\
    \ systems.  Unnamed roads and streets compound these challenges.  \n\nFurther,\
    \ local governments in Puerto Rico may not have the resources to build an address\
    \ data infrastructure to assign, collect, and maintain standardized and locatable\
    \ civic addresses, especially within vulnerable areas.  As a result, many communities\
    \ lack locatable civic addresses with a house number and a street name associated\
    \ with a geospatial coordinate that make them locatable by people and mapping\
    \ technology.  In other cases, where local governments have addressing programs,\
    \ the address database is not openly available, limiting the benefit to the community."

- Background: Opioid misuse, addiction, and overdose have reached crisis levels in
    the United States. From 1999 to 2016, the number of overdose deaths involving
    opioids increased more than five-fold, from about 8,000 to over 42,000. Both prescription
    and illicit opioids contribute to this trend. The opioid crisis extends beyond
    those suffering from addiction and overdose, to their families and communities.
    For example, the rate of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome increased more than
    five-fold between 2004 and 2014 with rising exposure to opioids before birth.
    Local and state governments struggle to provide opioid treatment and preventive
    services and target law enforcement efforts against the increasing traffic of
    illicit opioids. Meanwhile, opioid addiction removes patients and caregivers from
    the workforce. The White House Council of Economic Advisers recently estimated
    the economic toll of the opioid crisis at $504 billion in 2015, or 2.8 percent
    of GDP.
  Challenge: 'Create digital tools and data sharing capabilities to support decisions
    across the broad range of stakeholders responding to the opioid crisis, such as
    public health, public safety, law enforcement, community groups, the private sector,
    and individuals. '

  Vision for sprint outcomes: Holistic data systems provide real-time, large-scale,
    geographically-specific, multivariate data and data-analysis capabilities to guide
    decisions at all levels and reduce the burden of the opioid crisis on communities
    nationwide.
  Why this problem matters: "The opioid crisis exerts a tremendous human and economic\
    \ toll on America, and shows no sign of abating. The Administration\u2019s Office\
    \ of Science and Technology Policy established a Fast-Track Action Committee (FTAC),\
    \ which identified critical data gaps that hinder effective decision-making in\
    \ response to the opioid crisis, from the Federal level to state and local governments,\
    \ to community groups and individuals. New digital tools, data integration, and\
    \ data science approaches could address key questions such as: 1. How do geographic\
    \ location and local factors influence opioid misuse and addiction, and the effectiveness\
    \ of prevention and treatment programs based on location? 2. How can data from\
    \ law enforcement, public health, forensic laboratory, and other complementary\
    \ sources be integrated and analyzed to guide real-time response? 3. How do clinical\
    \ and medical coverage policies for pain management, and opioid misuse and addiction,\
    \ influence the landscape of the opioid crisis? 4. What is the geographic and\
    \ socio-cultural context of stigma with opioid misuse and addiction?"

- Background: "Worldwide and across the United States, cities and towns are grappling\
    \ with aging infrastructure, fluctuating populations, and a changing climate.\
    \ Public agencies cannot address these issues alone, which has led to involving\
    \ a growing network of civic stewardship organizations and volunteers to take\
    \ care of the city. Civic stewards ranging from NGOs to grassroots groups of neighbors\
    \ engage in conservation, management, monitoring, education, advocacy, and transformation\
    \ of local environments \u2013 through activities like forest restoration, storm\
    \ water management, community gardening, and more. But better tools are needed\
    \ to identify and track these groups, which often can be informal and hard to\
    \ find. Although public maps show green infrastructure and open space (e.g. forests,\
    \ parks, trees, gardens), there is no comprehensive map showing social infrastructure,\
    \ like the civic groups that care for--or steward--these sites in U.S. cities.\
    \ Over the past decade, USDA Forest Service research has found that civic stewardship\
    \ groups focused on different issues (e.g., tree care, clean water) can be working\
    \ in the same neighborhood, yet unaware of each other. Also, we have found that\
    \ some groups may be working on similar issues, but in different places and without\
    \ coordination. In order for stewards to overcome this isolation and maximize\
    \ the potential for productive collaboration, communities need digital resources\
    \ to locate and connect stewardship groups, as well as community leaders and interested\
    \ residents, across an entire town, city, or region."
  Challenge: 'Develop tools that visualize and provide access to the patterns, overlaps,
    and gaps in environmental stewardship efforts in order to identify local civic
    groups that support community quality of life and well-being, strengthen community

    pathways for collaboration, and improve the distribution of resources in a city. '
  Why this problem matters: "Communities need maps of social infrastructure because\
    \ civic groups are a crucial component of governing a city\u2019s environment.\
    \ Public agencies know which lands they manage and tax maps document private property\
    \ ownership, but civic groups that engage in stewardship can often be more difficult\
    \ to identify and locate. Research has found that civic stewardship groups focused\
    \ on different issues (e.g., tree care, clean water) can be working in the same\

    \ Stewardship Mapping and Assessment Project (STEW-MAP) created a reliable, replicable\
    \ survey methodology for identifying civic stewardship groups\u2019 presence,\
    \ capacity, geography, and social networks. This method has been piloted and prototyped\
    \ in 12 different locations globally, helping to identify thousands of civic stewardship\
    \ groups. Collaborators with expertise in interactive mapping, data visualization,\
    \ and database development can help to fully bring these new datasets to life\
    \ for end users, providing digital resources to stewardship groups that are organized,\
    \ but lack resources. Digital tools can leverage this data for social networking,\
    \ emphasizing the importance of collaboration and flows of knowledge and resources.\

    1. Municipal, county, tribal, and state decision makers who are responsible for planning and action, especially in underserved communities
    2. Climate adaptation/resilience professionals who provide local decision makers with expert guidance and translation services
  Vision for sprint outcomes: "Municipal, county, and tribal governments will be able\
    \ to quickly and easily find and integrate federal agencies\u2019 scientific and\
    \ socioeconomic data, and pair it  with their own local data. Communities of all\
    \ types will be empowered to understand their vulnerabilities and accelerate their\
    \ pace of climate resilience planning.  The availability of the resulting tools\
    \ will also reduce each community\u2019s planning costs."
  Why this problem matters: "Climate change-driven extreme events and patterns are\
    \ causing cascading problems in our nation\u2019s communities.  As the associated\
    \ frequency, severity, and costs increase, so, too, does the risk facing Americans,\
    \ especially those most vulnerable to climate impacts, such as poor, rural and\
    \ minority populations. \n\nUnfortunately, the pace and scale of climate-related\
    \ impacts are outpacing our nation\u2019s response. Both the average annual number\
    \ and combined cost damages of billion-dollar disasters (BDDs) in the United States\
    \ have quadrupled since 1980. Resilience to these growing threats must be built\
    \ locally, and local decision makers need data from all levels of government at\
    \ their fingertips to communicate about and address local climate-related risks\
    \ and opportunities."

    and elected officials, as well as city planners, transportation officials, public
    health authorities, individuals, households, NGOs serving them, others involved
    in planning
  Vision for sprint outcomes: Using accurate data on risk and outcomes of various
    climate adaptation strategies, future modeling techniques, and plain language
    messaging, emergency managers, state and local decision makers, and individuals
    will be better prepared to make informed and timely decisions to improve their

    highly technical information in easily understood, relatable ways to support individual
    and community decision making and help communities improve their climate resilience
    through systems-based investments in climate adaptation.
  Why this problem matters: "Climate change represents a profound crisis for the nation,\
    \ making natural disasters more frequent, more intense, and more destructive.\
    \  In 2020 alone, there were 22 weather and climate disaster events, with total\
    \ losses exceeding $1 billion across the U.S.  In comparison, the previous record\
    \ set in both 2011 and 2017 was 16 disasters.  Emergency managers in communities\
    \ across the country face increasing demands generated by more extreme and frequent\
    \ disasters \u2014 from wildfires and coastal storms to inland flooding \u2013\
    \ as well as climate-related emergencies such as drought and extreme heat. \n\n\
    The growing severity of disasters increases the time it takes for communities\
    \ to recover \u2014 a process that can be further complicated by repeat events\
    \ in areas already struggling to bounce back.  These cascading and compounding\
    \ impacts, propelled by climate change, pose the greatest risk to our communal\
    \ and nationwide resilience.  Natural disasters often disproportionately affect\
    \ people in underserved communities where weakened infrastructure, fewer resources,\
    \ and less support to invest in hazard mitigation can compound a disaster\u2019\
    s impact. \n\nTo help confront these threats, we must enhance the nation\u2019\
    s ability to anticipate, prepare for, and adapt to future climate conditions.\
    \  This starts with fostering a common understanding of how climate change will\
    \ reshape emergency management at both the community and household level, and\
    \ includes building better resources and tools to drive understanding of future\
    \ risk and enhance a community\u2019s ability to act.  While risk maps and climate\
    \ projection data for specific hazards exist, we do not yet have widely available\
    \ tools to help communities and individuals prioritize mitigation strategies based\
    \ on cost, impact, and other factors."

  Why this problem matters: "Basic education is an exercise in nation-building\u2014\
    and civics education, a capstone in citizenship. Investments in civics training\
    \ equip Americans, young and old, with an appreciation for democratic institutions:\
    \ why they exist, how they work, what they produce. But as civics has gone out\
    \ of vogue, so has Americans\u2019 support for institutions, at home and abroad.\
    \ Three out of four Americans believe the public\u2019s trust in the federal government\
    \ has been shrinking, and two out of three believe the same of one another. Consequently,\
    \ a growing share of Americans view democracy as a bad way to run government.\
    \ And beyond the country\u2019s shores, Americans on average believe foreign aid\
    \ constitutes about 26 percent of the federal budget, when the actual figure is\
    \ less than 1 percent. Such misinformation obscures the public\u2019s understanding\
    \ of America\u2019s role in the world. Given these worrying trends, civics training\
    \ is in need of a refresh\u2014one that puts digital tools in the hands of educators\
    \ to simplify the workings of government, and puts open data on the screens of\
    \ students to ground their learning in evidence-based examples. Data on U.S. foreign\
    \ assistance is an especially useful source because it spans nearly two dozen\
    \ federal agencies, touches the entire federal budget and spending process, and\
    \ offers a corrective to popular myths about the U.S. government. "

  Target audience / End user: Business decision makers, community and nonprofit organizations,

  Why this problem matters: Using census data to inform decision making can be challenging
    for businesses, community groups, and government leaders. Small businesses and
    nonprofits with limited resources dedicated to comprehensive analytics may struggle
    to navigate the data, identify relevant data points, and determine the implications
    for their business. Similarly, state and local government leaders are often constrained
    by time, capacity, and budget and therefore may not have the necessary bandwidth
    to conduct these analyses. However, the accurate distribution of resources on
    the state and local level is crucial to equitably providing services. Developing
    solutions to help these stakeholders utilize decennial data would ensure that
    smaller and less resourced businesses could make critical decisions, community
    organizations could gain insights into local needs, and funds could be accurately
    and equitable distributed.

  Why this problem matters: "In 2020, those who fell behind at least three months\
    \ on their mortgage increased 250 percent to over 2 million households. Collectively,\
    \ these households are estimated to owe almost $90 billion in deferred principal,\
    \ interest, taxes, and insurance payments. Similarly, over 8 million rental households\
    \ are behind in their rent. Now, as the economy recovers from the impacts of the\
    \ pandemic, eviction moratoriums established to help vulnerable renters will sunset,\
    \ potentially leading to households being displaced and/or individuals becoming\

    \ landlords, who are an important source of affordable housing, are not prepared\
    \ to weather missed tenant rent payments and may face the tough decision to evict\
    \ renters in order to retain their properties if assistance is not swiftly provided.\n\

  Background: 'Entrepreneurs create the companies that make up the industries of the
    future, and these companies will in turn recruit and train the workforce of the
    future. Young businesses create nearly all net new jobs in America, and contribute
    to 20% of gross job creation. Science and technology are the foundation for many
    high-growth startups, but companies with capital-intensive research and development
    (R&D) products also face some of the greatest challenges. For America to maintain
    its position as the leader of global innovation, it is imperative that we empower
    entrepreneurs with the support to translate research discovery into the new products
    and services in the marketplace that will make meaningful impact.   '
  Challenge: 'Develop tools to empower entrepreneurs and innovation ecosystem builders
    to find and navigate the variety of resources available across the federal government.  '

  Target audience / End user: Individuals starting or scaling high-growth, science
    and technology-based companies -- at any stage of their entrepreneurial journey
    (early stage, scale up or commercialization); innovation ecosystem builders ,
    including entrepreneur support organizations (ESOs), incubators, accelerators,
    seed funds, and state and local economic development leaders.
  Vision for sprint outcomes: 'Entrepreneurs are able to easily find and access opportunities
    for funding, expertise, equipment and facilities, and other resources, resulting
    in more and more inclusive R&D entrepreneurship. '
  Why this problem matters: "Entrepreneurs need flexible tools that allow them to\
    \ access the right resources at the right time.  Yet information about government\
    \ investment in intellectual property, expertise, equipment and facilities, and\
    \ publicly-available resources to support entrepreneurs is spread across government\
    \ agencies and websites.  Entrepreneurs unfamiliar with government may lack knowledge\
    \ about these resources and have difficulty navigating and finding them, posing\
    \ significant barriers to entry and keeping the best minds and ideas from reaching\
    \ their full potential.  Additionally, resources and access to capital are not\
    \ reaching all Americans evenly.  The best ideas can come from anywhere, but 80%\
    \ of all venture capital (VC) investment has been concentrated in just three states,\
    \ and in 2016, only 1% of VC dollars went to African-American and Latino founders,\
    \ and less than 2% went to female founders. Ensuring that access to resources\
    \ and capital are not relegated to a few regions but to all Americans is critical\
    \ to creating a robust and dynamic workforce and inclusive growth, and ensuring\
    \ the benefits of entrepreneurship not only accrue nationwide, not just in America\u2019\
    s largest cities."

- Background: State, local, and tribal governments, nonprofits, and universities complain
    that, despite the plethora of public data available, it can be dif cult to navigate
    information about federal programs, funding opportunities, and current awards
    to nd the best available resources to address their most pressing challenges.
    This is especially true for lower capacity entities who may not have as much experience
    partnering with the Federal government. Further, to manage and report on these
    awards, these organizations must interface with multiple Federal reporting requirements
    and systems, creating expensive administrative burden. The results of the DATA
    Act section 5 pilot indicate that burden is reduced when recipients are required
    to interact with fewer systems to partner with the Federal government, and when
    identical data can be entered once and reused as necessary.

    leaders navigate and manage Federal grants.'

  Vision for sprint outcomes: Leaders across America maximize return on Federal investments
    by navigating quickly to the resources best positioned to help them solve their
    toughest challenges, and access tools to ef ciently manage this partnership.
  Why this problem matters: "The Federal government spends more than $700 billion\
    \ annually on Federal financial assistance, equivalent to 20% of the Federal budget\
    \ and 5% of the United States gross domestic product. There are more than 40,000\
    \ organizations across the country that rely on Federal financial assistance,\
    \ which often accounts for 20-30% of a state or local government\u2019s revenue.\
    \ Federal grants support everything from local re ghters, police of cers, elementary\
    \ schools, buses, bridges, housing, school lunches, community health centers,\
    \ research to cure cancer or invent technology, and even the pipes we use to drink\
    \ water or ush toilets. Unfortunately, while there are multiple Federal data sets\
    \ and websites about these resources available to the public, not all local leaders\
    \ are able to nd and access the resources that could most bene t their communities.\
    \ Further, these resources are managed in a siloed way, authorized ad hoc over\
    \ time by Congress, and administered by separate departments within agencies,\
    \ with separate goals and requirements. For a single local government managing\
    \ multiple awards, the required reporting processes add up. This fragmentation\
    \ results in missed opportunities for alignment among complimentary Federal programs.\
    \ Our taxpayer dollars could go much further faster if those who use them could\
    \ access and manage them more seamlessly."

  Target audience / End user: Members of the public; transit agencies; local, regional,
    and state decision makers; climate adaptation/resilience and emergency preparedness
    professionals who provide local decision makers with expert guidance
  Why this problem matters: "Public transportation provides 10 billion trips each\
    \ year in the United States, improves mobility, and enhances quality of life for\
    \ millions of Americans.  Transit helps commuters get to work, customers reach\
    \ businesses, and rural residents access services, while providing essential mobility\
    \ for people who cannot drive or do not have access to a personal vehicle.\n\n\
    However, public transportation infrastructure is increasingly vulnerable to the\
    \ effects of climate change.  Impacts will vary, but all regions and public transportation\
    \ systems, large and small, will be affected.  Intense rainfall has already flooded\
    \ subway tunnels and low-lying facilities, bus lots, and rights-of-way.   Heat\
    \ waves will continue to stress materials, buckle rails, and jeopardize customer\
    \ and worker safety and comfort.  In the longer term, rising sea-levels, compounded\
    \ by worsening storm surges, will threaten assets in many coastal areas.\n\nClimate\
    \ impacts on transit assets will make it difficult to keep public transportation\
    \ systems in good repair and provide reliable and safe service, which may then\
    \ impact ridership.  Individuals with disabilities, older adults, and low-income\
    \ individuals\u2014groups who disproportionately depend on public transportation\u2014\
    \ will suffer from disruptions and degradation in service, which will have downstream\
    \ consequences on their ability to earn income, receive services, and participate\
    \ in social and civic life.\n\nAt the same time, transit can strengthen community\
    \ resiliency.  Transit evacuates people who are in harm\u2019s way and provides\
    \ mobility to people displaced by disasters.  Buses have served as cooling shelters\
    \ in heatwaves and some vehicles can even generate power in emergencies.  During\
    \ the COVID-19 pandemic, transit provided internet access and meal delivery, shuttled\
    \ tests to clinics, gave people free rides to vaccine locations, and served as\
    \ mobile vaccine clinics.\n"

  Background: The American dream is fading. Almost all children born in 1940 earned
    more than their parents, but the same was true for only half of children born
    in the 1980s. The decline in mobility is related to growing regional inequality.
    In a reversal of trends of the 20th century, regional income inequality has grown
    in the 2000s, making a person's place of birth an increasingly powerful predictor
    of their future income. The Opportunity Zone provision of the 2017 Tax Cut and
    Jobs Act created an incentive to invest in select low-income communities and is
    the core of a major effort to bring investment and opportunity to communities
    and is the core of a major effort to bring investment and opportunity to communities
    bypassed by recent econmic growth. To promote equality of opportunity across the
    US, we need data and tools to connect investors to the Opportunity Zones where
    their dollars will do the most good. Private sector developers can use their talents
    to bring together multiple sources of public data, as well as private data, to
    create new data products that enable investment in overlooked places.

    leaders, entrepreneurs, and workers of America's 8,764 Opportunity Zones

  Target audience / End user: Entrepreneurs, managers of Opportunity Zone funds, and
    community leaders in Opportunity Zones
  Vision for sprint outcomes: Through better access to consolidated data, more investors,
    entrepreneurs, and community leaders will discover opportunities for economic
    development in overlooked Opportunity Zones.
  Why this problem matters: Opportunity Zones are a promising way to revitalize low-income
    communities and bring jobs to local residents.  But this can only occur if investors
    match their capital with the right people and places.  Many low-income communities
    selected to be Opportunity Zones have few resources to market themselves to investors.
    A community may have easy access to transportation infrastructure, low-cost real
    estate, a well-trained workforce, and natural resources, but lack the means to
    document these assets and bring them to the attention of investors. Investors,
    on the other hand, may tend to flock to the most well-known areas for promising
    investment projects and overlook communities with under-studied and under-appreciated
    potential.

  Why this problem matters: Rural economies must maintain a fine balance between economic
    competitiveness and agricultural and natural land conservation, as well as between
    maintaining existing roads, sewers, and buildings and funding for services needed
    to help residents maintain a good quality of life. In particular, rural communities
    located close to metropolitan areas or amenities (e.g., ski areas, national parks)
    may struggle to preserve their rural character in the face of growth pressures,
    as they experience conversion of farmland and natural land to development. Rural
    communities can achieve their goals for growth and development while maintaining
    their distinctive rural character by encouraging growth in town, where businesses
    can thrive on a walkable main street and families can live close to their daily
    destinations, protect rural landscapes, improve air and water quality, provide
    places for recreation, and create tourist attractions that bring investments into
    the local economy.

  Target audience / End user: Individuals ages 18-34 and influencers within communities,
    to include faith leaders, emergency managers, and leaders of civic organizations.
  Vision for sprint outcomes: 'Through access to data and user friendly digital tools,
    more Americans are aware of the hazards they face and what they can do to protect
    themselves and their families, and take action to get prepared. '
  Why this problem matters: "Current research suggests that exposure to preparedness\
    \ messaging shows a significant relationship to taking preparedness action\u2014\
    almost doubling the percentage of individuals with an emergency plan (58%) compared\
    \ to those not exposed to preparedness messaging (34%). A major objective of FEMA\u2019\
    s strategic effort to build a culture of preparedness across the nation is helping\
    \ people to prepare for disasters. As demonstrated on September 11, 2001, the\
    \ preparedness level of private citizens can weigh heavily on the outcome of an\
    \ incident, especially a no-notice event. On that day, only 5.36% of building\
    \ occupants who perished in the World Trade Center collapse worked below the impact\
    \ zones. This low mortality rate is attributed to the preparedness advancements\
    \ set in place prior to September 11, 2001, and led the 9-11 commission to conclude\
    \ that citizens across the nation need to be prepared to maximize their odds of\
    \ survival should disaster strike. Changing attitudes and achieving a true culture\
    \ of preparedness across the nation will require a paradigm shift in how we deliver\
    \ information, particularly to younger Americans. "

  Why this problem matters: 'As the U.S. Census Bureau continues to release and disseminate
    data collected in the 2020 Census, new approaches are needed to share the data
    in ways that resonate with the public, especially historically undercounted communities.
    Creative methods beyond traditional press releases, webinars, or data tables have
    the potential to more inclusively share the data in ways that resonate with different
    communities. Demonstrating how decennial data can be leveraged to tackle community
    needs, illustrating ways in which decision makers use the data, and helping communities
    see themselves represented in the numbers are critical steps to ensuring the public
    is engaged with census data and understands its importance as we look to ensuring
    accurate future counts in 2030 and beyond, and increased public trust in government.  Examples
    of alternative and creative methods of sharing data might include works of art
    based on the data, leveraging new media platforms, and participatory approaches. '

  Vision for sprint outcomes: Deliver essential and timely information to stakeholders

  Why this problem matters: "Over the past year, the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s global\
    \ shutdowns challenged many past assumptions about affordable housing needs. Office\
    \ worker commutes and business travel fell suddenly and sharply, with 60 million\
    \ fewer commuting miles as 37.1% worked from home. Some social and economic patterns\
    \ are likely to return after the pandemic, while others may continue in a changed\
    \ form or be gone forever. \n\nThe housing needs of both remote workers (e.g.,\
    \ office jobs) and on-site workers (e.g., restaurants, delivery, hospitality,\
    \ etc.) are shifting. Affordability may change for some urban areas, as people\
    \ relocate to desirable and newly achievable places including the less expensive\
    \ exurbs of large cities, to lower-cost southern states, and to communities that\
    \ facilitate non-work activities. \n\nGiven these changing circumstances, understanding\
    \ and predicting where housing may become more affordable, which locations may\
    \ require additional housing assistance, and what strategies may be employed to\
    \ support those who cannot afford costly housing or relocation will be pivotal\
    \ to ensuring an equitable recovery."

  Target audience / End user: Local governments and NGOs who need to communicate with
    diverse language speakers in the United States. The majority of target users will
    be people who manage digital and print content within public-facing institutions.

    source data pipeline that moves digital content to one or more translation tools,
    and back into content management systems, for the benefit of any public-facing
    agency delivering digital content in multiple languages. Residents of New York
    City can access all resources equitably; all content is available to all major
