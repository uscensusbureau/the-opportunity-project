    plain-text: TOP aims to solve real-world problems facing individuals and communities. Problem statement development leverages your agency’s unique policy expertise to articulate specific national challenges requiring innovation, for which tech teams develop solutions. Each problem statement will outline the background and history of the challenge, potential end users who would benefit from a digital product, as well as some relevant data sets.
    highlight: Be sure to review the Resources section below for guidelines, examples of past problem statements, and a template for writing your own.
