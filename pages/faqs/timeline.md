### What if the sprint timeline doesn’t work for me?

There are many other ways you can engage with The Opportunity Project that can meet your own needs. If you are interested in any of these options, send an email to [{{ site.contacts.email }}](mailto:{{ site.contacts.email }}) to get in touch with the TOP team.
- [The Opportunity Project Toolkit](../product-development/toolkit): for technologists, students, civic tech groups, and others to follow the sprint process and build their own products. Any team that uses the toolkit may be eligible to apply for the TOP prize challenge.
- [TOPx for federal agencies](../topx-toolkit/introduction): specifically for agencies looking to run a sprint on a flexible and modifiable timeline, the TOPx toolkit open-sources the TOP model of sprint facilitation. The TOP team is available to offer support to your team and guide you through this process.
