We’re excited to share a new way for the public to get involved in TOP this fall! We’re partnering with The American Statistical Association (ASA) on the 2021 [Annual Data Challenge Expo](https://community.amstat.org/dataexpo/home), which is a competition with cash prizes for the best analysis and visualization of Census Bureau data. The theme of this year’s challenge is “Helping Families, Business, and Communities Respond to COVID-19” ([download the problem statement](../assets/files/covid-19-top-asa-problem-statement.pdf) to learn more and view examples of problems you could focus on).

Through the Expo, contestants are challenged to analyze the U.S. Census Bureau [2019 American Community Survey (ACS) 1-year Estimates](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-kits/2020/acs-1year.html) using statistical and visualization tools and methods, and present their findings at ASA’s Joint Statistical Meeting (JSM).
Note: The challenge requires applicants to use the ACS 1-year estimates, but you are encouraged to use others as well, and additional data sets and points of contact can be found on [The Opportunity Project Data Curation Hub](../data/covid-19).

We also encourage you to develop digital products as part of your participation in the challenge. For a guidebook on transforming federal open data into digital tools for the American people, visit [The Opportunity Project Product Development Toolkit](https://opportunity.census.gov/product-development/toolkit/).
