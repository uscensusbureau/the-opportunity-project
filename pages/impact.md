  <h2>Note from the Team</h2>
  <div class="shadow-box">
    <p>We’ve seen firsthand the power of open innovation to inspire new ideas, unexpected partnerships, and meaningful solutions. The secret behind The Opportunity Project’s longevity and success isn’t just the process, it’s the people. Time and again, Americans have shown up with creativity, urgency, and purpose to help solve big problems.</p>
    <p>This work has lasted because we’ve stayed true to our guiding principles: being radically responsive, efficient, and helpful. We’ve never lost sight of our responsibility to make the best use of every taxpayer dollar. That mindset has allowed us to move fast, work smarter, and deliver value that’s both immediate and long-lasting.</p>
