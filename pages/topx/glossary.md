        num: 1
        term: Beta Demo
        definition: An informal demonstration or presentation of a tech product in progress, usually with some early version of working features.

        num: 2
        term: End User
        definition: The person for whom a tech product is designed.

        num: 3
        term: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
        definition: A product with enough features to attract early-adopter customers and validate a product idea early in the product development cycle.
      - link: https://visme.co/blog/what-is-a-mockup/
        num: 4
        term: Mockup
        definition: A sketch that represents the way a product will look.

        num: 5
        term: Usability Testing
        definition: The practice of testing how easy a design is to use for a group of representative users. It usually involves observing users as they attempt to complete tasks and can be done for different types of designs, from user interfaces to physical products.
      - link: https://www.experienceux.co.uk/faqs/what-are-user-journeys/
        num: 6
        term: User Journey
        definition: A path a user may take to reach their goal when using a particular digital tool. User journeys are used in designing digital tools to identify the different ways to enable the user to achieve their goal as quickly and easily as possible.
      - link: https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/user-research
        num: 7
        term: User Research
        definition: Interviews, focus groups, user tests, and other techniques conducted to understand the target audience of a product, or ‘end users’.  This includes their goals, needs, interests, and preferences. User research helps teams produce designs that improve users’ working practices and lives. User research also involves the continuous evaluation of the impact of designs on the users, not only during the design and development phase but after long-term use, too.
      - link: https://www.experienceux.co.uk/faqs/what-is-wireframing/
        num: 8
        term: Wireframe
        definition: An initial design of a website or app at the structural level. A wireframe is commonly used to lay out content and functionality on a page which takes into account user needs and user journeys. Wireframes are used early in the development process to establish the basic structure of a page before visual design and content is added.

      - link: 
        num: 10
        term: Data Exploration Phase/Milestone
        definition: During the data exploration sprint phase, teams explore federal government open datasets to identify data they can use in their sprint products. During the data exploration milestone at the end of that phase, teams connect with federal data stewards to present what they’ve learned and ask questions about how to find and work with federal data.

        num: 11
        term: Data Steward

        link: 
        term: MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Demo Milestone
        definition: The final milestone of the sprint process, in which teams present their ‘MVP’ to the sprint leaders to culminate the sprint. Their MVP should include working features and be ready for use by an end user, but can be improved upon in the future, especially after receiving user feedback.
